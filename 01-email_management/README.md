## Specific Packages

### MailChimp - For Reference

- https://mailchimp.com/

Really want to DIY on this, so this info is just for comparison purposes.

- Free for up to 2,000 list members, 12,000 emails/month
- Must pay $10/month for branding, support, etc.

### MailMan - GNU Mailer

- http://www.list.org/index.html

Looked at this a bit:

- Written in python (good!)
- Looks like overkill:
  - Looks like it is meant to be a ListServ-type package
  - Can configure to be out-going only but -- why have all that additional functionality?
- Current version is 3.2.0 but the docs seem to be all about version 2
  - Conversion process is not trivial

### Dada Mail

- https://dadamailproject.com/

Initial impressions:

- Written in perl ...
- Free for up to 500 users and 3 lists
- Must pay for the manual
  - $99.95/year for that and other services
